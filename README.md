### Welcome 👋

Here's my repo on a personal website design I'm working on. I've done a few things using basic HTML and CSS but hopefully soon I can incorporate JavaScript to improve the animation of the website.

## Observation
Currently very pixelated, I've done a few minor adjustments but nothing very presentable.
